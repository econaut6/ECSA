# Scope of Work

The following work items will be iterated in GitHub by CIVICS.com for ECSA.io under Creative Commons, MIT or other open licenses until and unless otherwise agreed by CIVICS.com and ECSA.  

## v0.1 of "BLT Matrix"

* Description: The "BLT Matrix" provides a simplified table format tool to quickly, visually organize and understand relevant interconneted business legal and technical facets of Space, Accelerator and Gravity and thereby to cohere Space, Accelerator and Gravity.  
* Purposes: This deliverable is intended to assist with a Space offering. This deliverabe is intended to assist with eventually providing predictable legal outcomes for those who operate in, through or rely upon Space, Accelerator and Gravity.
* Provisos: Whether or the extent to which this deliverable is capable of cohereing Space, Accelerator and Gravity is subject to receiving adequate Space, Accelerator and Gravity inputs in a usable and timely manner.  
* Provisos: This deliverable will be very high level, in mostly or entirely outline format and broadly general in nature.  Advice of counsel is recommended for iteration of legal instruments and processes  described in the legal part of a BLT Matrix and definite or specific legal components appropriate for operational use are out of scope of this architectural deliverable.

v0.1 of "Legal Architecture" 

* Descrption: This del (?)
* Purpose: This deliverable is intended to assist with a Space offering. 
* Provisos: This deliverable will be very high level, in mostly or entirely outline format and broadly general in nature.  Advice of counsel is recommended for iteration of legal instruments and processes  described in a legal architecture and definite or specific legal components appropriate for operational use are out of scope of this architectural deliverable.

Q: How do we get the legal architecture ready for immediate private round, to midterm public round, to long term network launch?

v0.1 of "Open Source GitHub Production Model" in a form that is usable by ECSA teams
* Description: This production model will include checklists, a workflow diagram and 
Milestone: Used by all teams within 1 month

v0.1 of an open-source project to compose and express contracts through collaborative creation with modular components

* Thanks.

Milestone: Participating in MIT legal forum as one of the breakout groups. Q: How can we become a key player in the emerging computational law/computable contracts space?
